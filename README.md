ðŸ’ª Inspired by an amazing work of [Vijay](https://github.com/vijay2181/k8s-500-prod-issues) â€” I've âœ¨ sprinkled a bit of sugar on top with a website to make exploring real-world Kubernetes production issues ðŸ”¥ a little more fun ðŸ¤©.

## How I built this?
- Used v0 to build the UX with few prompts, see [v0 prompts](prompts/v0.txt)
- Deployed to Vercel directly from v0, with custom domain.
- All scenarios (500 of them) converted to array by prompting Cursor and using Agents to write/run the script, [see the script here](scripts/convertScenarios.js).
- Updated the scenarios [array here](lib/data.ts).
- Replaced logo from unused logo collection of prometheus-operator, [see here](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/3389#issuecomment-2879799832). Converted png to svg and placed it in [here](./components/icons.tsx).
- Converted logo to favicon, and uploaded in [apps/](apps/) directory.
